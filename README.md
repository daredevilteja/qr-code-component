## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I revisited some of flex concepts while building this project. Flex provides a easy way to style things and would inherently make your project mobile-friendly.

### Continued development

I want to make this project more responsive and polished. I want to make the transition of the page more smoother when the window size is changed.
